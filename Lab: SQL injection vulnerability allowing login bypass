This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user.
access lab then:
go to login
then add --> administrator in username space
add psss --> anypass then enter
then their is invalid username and pass

think the sql query will go like--> select * from users where username='administrator' AND password=' '
both username and password must be same for login.
now if we add username like--> administrator'--
and pass can be any wordings.this will login the page.

"--"  used for comment in sql so we have commented the part from AND .

now username is--> administrator
