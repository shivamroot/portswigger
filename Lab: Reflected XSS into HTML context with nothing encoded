Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
This lab contains a simple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search functionality.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.
in search bar search for hi then inspect.
now their is <hi>hi</h1> will shown .
now we can end h1 tag and start script tag and then add alert function in that script tag.
now give input as ==> "><script>alert("xss by shivam")</script>
