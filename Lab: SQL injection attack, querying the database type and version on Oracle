200 ok is shown
then after --> GET /filter?category=Tech+gifts add ' sign to check that can we attack by sql injection.after add ' and hiting send if their is 500 interna server error 
then also add--> -- after ' if their shows original 200 ok then we can attack by sql injection.

given that we have to use UNION for this attack.
so original command in the repeater is --> GET /filter?category=Tech+gifts
now after add ' after original command their is 500 error so 
adding '-- after original command so (-- used for comment in sql) click send their is no error.
so we have to inject malicious script before(--) and after(') script must be contain UNION keyword,so
1.first command--> '+UNION+SELECT+NULL--        then click send.500 internal server error.
2.second command--> '+UNION+SELECT+NULL<NULL--   then click send.
